# Large-language-Model
This repo contains experiments on fine-tuning language models for dialogue summarization. The goal is to take a conversation between two or more people and generate a concise summary of the key points.

## The key areas explored:

- Fine-tuning FLAN-T5 on dialogue summarization data
- Evaluating on test set with ROUGE metrics
- Using LoRA for parameter efficient fine-tuning
- Comparing full fine-tuning vs LoRA on efficiency and performance
